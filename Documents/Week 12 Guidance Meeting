Asked for requirements

Spencer asking questions about AC current readings
  Decide on how accurate we want the current reading to be
  
  Most accurate point should be around 700mA
  
  Test multiple situations for block check-off
  We define how well the block works from interfaces and requirements
    Change interface definitions to apply to just the block instead of the system
    
    Define clear properties so that indivuduals can work on their own.
    Pictures function as proper documentation
    
   Videos are encouraged for block checkoff
   
   Enclosures are expected to have connectors
   
   3D printer available via JD class
   Laser-Cutting also viable option
   
   Hweekend has available bluetooth project code
   
   Adjust time of PWM pulse but keeping same frequency
   
   Possibly start creating a list of materials for PCB
   Recommend KiCAD for design.
