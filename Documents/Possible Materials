    - https://medium.com/@urish/start-building-with-web-bluetooth-and-progressive-web-apps-6534835959a6

Power Supply
    - 120 VAC to 10 VAC Transformer (https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Hammond-Manufacturing/BC2DA/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvwUzoUXIIvyW8HfC4QLhUe2ZHvpTClyus%3D)

General Things:
    - Mains Isolation (PCB must have large gap of no conductors between High and Low Voltage areas
    - Use mechanical relays for AC control ( https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/119 )
