Stakeholder meeting 1 11/14/17

Engineering reuqirements
  Each channel should work at the same time.
  Needs to report current and power is being drawn
    Needs to be reported on the App
    App must be simple
    App has to run on android

   Safety
    Nothing beyond the 1mm must enter the enclosure
    No wires showing, etc
    
    Strip or cover will work, but same safety either way
    5A MAX, but you can draw lower
    
  Timer
  Can tell the lights to turn on or off
  or put a timer on the channels, plus or minus a minute
  Max timer can go above an hour (Could be an additional contribution)
  Minute time intervals 
  1 plug per timer
  
  Power
  Provide power updates every 10 minutes, and it can be average
  Instantaneuos would be nice
  
  Display on device
  Up to us
  
  Can add plugs to channels (Possible additions)
  
  Bluetooth Fail:
  Continue working normally.
  Possible tolerance
  Possibly tell user they are outside the range
  
  Default Setting:
  Channels disabled, and turn on via the app (safest option)
  Could possibly configure to personal prefernces
  
  Bluetooth notification
    An LED that determines the state of the device
      Paired
      Ready to pair
      Overheating
 
  Can only use existing power supply
  Could possibly put small power supply inside enclosure
    Up to us
    
  Current Sensing Ideas:
    Review existing architetures
    Have a higher rating than 5A (Due to variation)
    Sensor should be able to handle most currents
  
  We plan on using timer on microController
    Make sure the MC has the range to go to an hour
  
  Do a review that our hardware will be safe and meet our requirements
  Then devy up tasks
  
  No reports or anything
  Questions or concerns we can reach out to her.
  
  
ADDITIONS:
  Reporting Power:
    Could work, but it is continuation of the project
  Display on the device:
    Is allowed
  Sound Alert:
    Is allowed, possibly include other alerts
